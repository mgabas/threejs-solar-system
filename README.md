# 🌌 Solar System Explorer – A Three.js Project

This project is mostly assisted by Generative Artifical Intelligence, with the code being generated by AI and then refined by me.

This is a 3D interactive simulation of the Solar System built using **Three.js**. The project is designed to help 
improve my skills in Three.js by creating a visually and technically instructive representation of our solar neighborhood.
And enhance my prompting skills by generating part of the code with AI.


## 🚀 Features

- Realistic models of the Sun and all 8 planets
- Orbit animations with adjustable speed
- Interactive controls for camera movement (free cam and locked-on-planet modes)
- Clickable planets with info overlays
- Earth’s moon with independent orbit
- A basic asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter
- Starfield background to simulate deep space
- Keyboard and mouse/touch controls
- Pause/play, reset view, and speed adjustment

## 🎮 Controls

### Mouse / Touch
- **Drag:** Orbit around the solar system
- **Scroll:** Zoom in/out
- **Click on planet:** Lock camera and display planet info

### Keyboard
- **Z / Q / S / D:** Move camera in free cam mode

### UI Buttons
- **Pause:** Stop the simulation
- **Reset View:** Return to default camera view
- **Free Camera:** Enable manual camera control

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (r128 via CDN)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Texture loading via `TextureLoader`
- PointLight and AmbientLight for illumination

## 📁 Project Structure

```
/assets
    - sun-texture.png
    - earth-texture.png
    - moon-texture.jpg
index.html
README.md
```

> Make sure you have the correct planet and moon textures inside the `/assets` directory as expected by the script.

## 🚧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have a local server to bypass CORS when loading textures. You can use Python's simple server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.

## 🧑‍🎓 Learning Objectives

This project is a self-guided initiative to:
- Practice scene setup and object management in Three.js
- Implement camera and object interactions
- Understand real-time animation loops
- Improve UI/UX in 3D contexts
- Enhance skills in using AI for code generation and refinement

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add textures for more planets
- Include more moons per planet
- Introduce lighting variations (e.g., eclipses)
- Enhance orbit lines and trails
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add more celestial objects (e.g., comets, dwarf planets)
